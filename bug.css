The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an unusual error that can occur when using the `calc()` function with percentages and units that don't directly convert:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```

While this looks straightforward, it can unexpectedly break in older browsers or in certain situations. The issue arises because `calc()` requires compatible units within its operations. If a browser doesn't correctly parse the subtraction of pixels from a percentage, the width might become invalid, resulting in unexpected rendering.
